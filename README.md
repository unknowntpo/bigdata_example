Example of Twitter activity usecase.

Every hour, we have lots of twitter event data.

- Tweets 
- Comments
- Retweets

These events are stored in Hadoop, may be partitioned by hour.

## Goal:
Analyze active celebrity, tweets, and recommend to user.

We need to use these tool for demo purpose: 

- Spark
- Hive
- Flink

And load generator is needed for generating tweets, comments, retweets.
