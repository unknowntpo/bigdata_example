# Twitter Analytics System with Hadoop - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive Twitter analytics system using Hadoop ecosystem for analyzing celebrity activity, tweets, and providing recommendations to users.

## System Architecture

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Hadoop Cluster**: HDFS for storage, YARN for resource management
- **Processing Engines**: Spark for batch processing, Flink for stream processing  
- **Data Storage**: Hive for SQL queries with PostgreSQL metastore
- **Message Queue**: Kafka for real-time data ingestion
- **Load Generator**: Custom Java service for generating tweet data

### Data Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Kafka receives tweet events (tweets, comments, retweets)
2. **Storage**: HDFS stores data partitioned by hour
3. **Processing**: Spark/Flink process data for analytics
4. **Querying**: Hive provides SQL interface for data analysis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup âœ…
- [x] Docker Compose with Hadoop ecosystem
- [x] Hadoop configuration files (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, yarn-site.xml, mapred-site.xml)
- [ ] Spark Master/Worker services
- [ ] Hive with PostgreSQL metastore
- [ ] Kafka service
- [ ] Initialization scripts

### Phase 2: Application Foundation (User Implementation)
- [ ] Update Gradle dependencies (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka clients)
- [ ] Data Models (Tweet, Comment, Retweet POJOs)
- [ ] Data Generator Service (Kafka producer)
- [ ] Configuration management

### Phase 3: Analytics Implementation (User Implementation)
- [ ] Spark Jobs for celebrity ranking
- [ ] Hourly tweet analysis
- [ ] Real-time processing with Kafka consumers
- [ ] HDFS utilities for data storage
- [ ] Hive table creation and partitioning

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] End-to-end data pipeline testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides

## Key Features to Implement
- Hourly partitioned tweet data in HDFS
- Real-time celebrity activity tracking  
- Batch processing for trend analysis
- Tweet recommendation engine
- Scalable microservices architecture

## Development Approach
- Infrastructure: Implemented by Assistant
- Application Logic: Guided implementation by User
- Step-by-step tutorial approach with hands-on coding practice
